# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security-related issues, please report them to our security team via email at [circle@trueai.org](mailto:circle@trueai.org). Please refrain from posting security-related issues publicly until we have had a chance to address them.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

When a vulnerability report is received, we will do our best to respond in a timely manner, typically within 5 business days. We will work with the reporter to confirm the vulnerability and reproduce it, as needed. Once validated, we will develop and release patches or updates as soon as possible.

We appreciate the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and the cooperation of the community in helping us maintain the security of our projects.
